# UnitTesting


PLEASE NOTE - this is only a practice project that I am using to help me understand VCS better. Project covers: 

Unit testing, different types of assertions and assumptions as well as adnotations used while testing in JUnit 5. Also, I have practiced 
working with Maven in IntelliJ IDE - which is my new way to go IDE! So far I have covered testing using hamcrest and assertJ along with 
Jacoco plugin to help me understand test coverege a little bit better.

Thanks,

# UnitTesting


This is a practice project that I am using to help me understand unit testing and version control in Intellij Idea IDE. Project covers:

Unit testing, different types of assertions and assumptions as well as adnotations used while testing in JUnit 5. So far I have covered testing using hamcrest and assertJ along with Jacoco plugin to help me understand test coverege a little bit better. Second branch extends application by mockito, I have practiced mocks and stubs but also tried Test Driven Development.
